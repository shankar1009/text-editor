Goal is to implement a simple text editor with a font family, font weight and italic
selector that instantly changes the font of the entire text. Font selector must show a list
of all google fonts and font weight selector shows the appropriate font weights
supported for the selected font family. Italic toggle is only active if the selected font
family and weight combination supports italic. You also need to implement auto save
which saves the text and font family locally in the browser. On reloading the page,
existing content should load and correct font family and variant should be selected in
the dropdown.
